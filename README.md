# togethr

this is the frontend for togethr, a webapp for submitting tickets for mutual aid assistance.

to use, you also need the togethr_api rails server which can be found [here](https://github.com/aaron-schuyler/togethr-api)

follow the installation instructions on the serverside, and then to run simply install dependencies and run the start script:

`npm install`

`npm start`

This app is still in development phases, and is not ready to deploy. To deploy as is you would need to create environment variables for the API url, and simply run `npm build`
